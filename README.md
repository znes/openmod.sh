## Acknowledgement

The initial development of openMod.sh was funded from September 2014 until
March 2017 by the Gesellschaft für Energie und Klimaschutz Schleswig-Holstein
GmbH (EKSH), by the ARGE Netz GmbH & Co. KG and by the  Arbeitsgemeinschaft der
Industrie- und Handelskammern zu Flensburg, zu Kiel und zu Lübeck (IHK
Schleswig-Holstein).

## Requirements

The packages that `openmod.sh` depends on are listed in `requirements.txt`.
So until `openmod.sh` is properly packaged, it's best to just do:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

to install all necessary requirements.

## Configuration

`Openmod.sh` depends on `oemof.db`. Have a look at it's [README][0] for
information on how to configure database access. Note that `openMod.sh`
expects its database configuration to be in a `config.ini` section named
`openMod.sh R/W`. Be careful. As the 'R/W' suggests, the editor expects
read and write access. Additionaly to the standard `oemof.db` options the
following section have to be specified:
schema: e.g. public, the database schema to be used
webport: e.g. 8000, the port being used when running openmod.sh.py.

A full config section will look like this:

  ```
  [openMod.sh R/W]
  username = test_user
  database = test_db
  host     = localhost
  port     = 5432
  pw       = test_pw
  schema   = test_schema
  webport  = 8000
  login_disabled = false
  ```
The standard location for it is in a folder called `.oemof/` in your home
directory.


## Installation and Execution

As `openmod.sh` is not a full fledged python package yet, there's really
nothing to install, you'll have to clone the repository manually. As mentioned
in [Requirements](#requirements). After you have done this, you should have a
directory containing the source code for `openmod.sh`. Let's call it
OPENMOD.SH for the reminder of this section.

## Setting up the `openmod.sh` database (aka.: create the tables)

`Openmod.sh` expects its database structure to already be set up in a
working state so that all necessary tables already exist and data can be
queried and stored. Setting things up is best achieved by a few lines of
Python code, which the fine folks behind [flask-sqlalchemy][1] were
kind enough to [document][2].

Initializing the application to work with flask-sqlalchemy is taken care
of in the `openmod.sh` codebase, so all you have to do is import the
right modules, push an application context, create the tables and commit
the transaction. To do so, `cd` into the repository's directory and run:

  ```
  python setup-database.py
  ```

Note that the specified user, database and schema from the config section have
to exist beforehand in the posgresql database. Additionally the postgis
extension is needed. Also the POSTGIS extension for postgres needs to be installed
and activated.


## Ready to start

Now you're ready to start `openmod.sh` which is as simple as

  ```
  python openmod.sh.py
  ```

Note that you should still be residing in OPENMOD.SH, obviously.
Then open your browser and point it to the port which is specified in
`config.ini`.

To import a scenario navigate to the `Import` page and choose a suitable file on
your hard disc. You can find example files in `OPENMOD.SH/data/scenarios`.

Enjoy.
